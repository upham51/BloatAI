## Paywall Bypass (for Testing)

This project includes a temporary paywall bypass feature for testing purposes.

### How to Bypass the Paywall

To allow users to sign up and access the app without payment:

1. Open the `.env` file in the project root
2. Set `VITE_BYPASS_PAYWALL="true"`
3. Restart the development server (`npm run dev`)

When the bypass is active:
- All authenticated users will have free access to the app
- Users are treated as having a free annual plan
- A yellow banner appears at the top of protected pages indicating bypass is active

### How to Re-enable the Paywall

To turn the paywall back on:

1. Open the `.env` file
2. Set `VITE_BYPASS_PAYWALL="false"` (or remove the line entirely)
3. Restart the development server

**Note:** The bypass only affects frontend access control. To permanently grant users free subscriptions (e.g., to grandfather early testers), use the admin panel's subscription management tools after they sign up.
